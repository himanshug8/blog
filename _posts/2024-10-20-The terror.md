Suppose for a second that you have no fear in you heart, fear being what's going to happen in the future, it can be the next moment or a year later. You see the absurdity and superficiality of this fear. Now, suppose you are walking on the street and suddenly a lion appears from the traffic. Even though their is no fear in your heart, your body will react, because you know lion can eat you or maybe not because many people are around it could be anyone, but you body will show fear, it will sweat, it will react, your bp will spike, your feet will go cold. Its the natural instinct of the body to save itself even though your mind is blank. But if your mind is not blank and is anticipating like crazy then everything in your body will feel hundred folds.

Now if one is in stressful situation like mentally ill father, or mother or anything violent. Someone is beating the other. Or throwing cups on the floor anything that can switch on your flight mode. If you do not anticipate in you mind, your body anyway going to react. The bp will spike, the feet will grow cold. Thats natural. Test it, see if its true.
