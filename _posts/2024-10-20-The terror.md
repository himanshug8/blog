Suppose for a second that you have no fear in you heart, fear being what's going to happen in the future, it can be the next moment or a year later. You see the absurdity and superficiality of this fear. Now, suppose you are walking on the street and suddenly a lion appears from the traffic. Even though their is no fear in your heart, your body will react, because you know lion can eat you or maybe not because many people are around it could be anyone, but you body will show fear, it will sweat, it will react, your bp will spike, your feet will grow cold. Its the natural instinct of the body to save itself even though your mind is blank. But if your mind is not blank and is anticipating like crazy then everything in your body will feel hundred folds. your heart will be thumping in your chest, you will sweat from the places you didn't knew possible and you will feel you are going to go in shock and fall freeze.

Or throwing cups on the floor or shouting anything that can switch on your flight mode. If you do not anticipate in you mind, or you understand the superficiality of thoughts that are anticipating and it ceases naturally. Your body anyway going to react. The bp will spike, your feet will grow cold. Thats natural. Test it, see, if its true.
