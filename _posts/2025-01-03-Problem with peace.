When you finally go out because the home situation is eating you away and you  
want freedom and you want a college where you are going to be free, for people like us college is not a place to discover our calling, its a place to avoid the 
home situation because you don't want to suffer and you just need peace.

During you college life you do what you want to do, no one is there to stop you not even the memories of that home you used to live sickly. Now, that you are away and a year is passed, you seem to observe that the home situation is also going better, they are taking to you nicely, poring love over you when you visit home and everything seems to good to be true but it's true.

In the college years you have learned that people are manipulative, can use your desires against you and are power seeking, domination personalities and you have learned about it and you are looking for peace, and you do what you are best at distance yourself, looking for the hints, not confronting, because you have learned in you home that standing up for yourself and confronting can lead to more conflict because you understand that you can not change people, so you have learned to distance yourself without explaining why you are distancing if you see a person is negative in anyway, its like a hack that works all the time, you see negativity you distance, no other way, no matter the situation or place, distancing is the best tested option, because setting boundary has a opposite effect if a person is narcissistic.

you are living in a bubble of peace that you have created for yourself carefully choosing people in you life, carefully choosing the workplace, or a subject that is conflict free, but for some reason you see every one is chasing power, when a group is introduced one is in power and doing every possible thing to stay in power and another is trying to come in power, doing anything to come in power and you have to choose to exist in the group and you like other as a person because she is attractive and you like another person because you see he is good to you. Anywhere you go, people are not creating conflict they are conflict, all you were looking for was peace, a moment of peace.

You leave everything, you shift to you home thinking the only peace is at home, you take a break from the job, you distance yourself from your friends and you are finally at peace at you home thinking about how fucked-up the world is but.... When you see the same thing that your mother is as manipulative as people who are outside, and she is unconscious about it, she is also seeking power where her sons and daughter listen to her and she can go to any length to stay in power from throwing ceramic cups in anger or giving silent treatment and same with you father who is a control freak who wants things to be the way he wants them to be like switching of the lights when not in use, if you forget it one time, its death lecture for you, the room should be like this, your hair, the fridge, the bed, the wall, everything has to be neat. After a while you starts to see the house from the eyes of you father. When you are making bed, you think of how he would do it, when you are doing the dishes you are making sure the things are placed where he would want them to be and after a while you find yourself in conflict again and a conflict that big that you have never experience.

Then you see the problem because when these thing used to happen outside you just used to distance yourself, but now you are at home still suffering, thats why people on the internet says that if you live with your parents you pay with your mental health and that true because you really pay it with it, but I see that outside i would just walk away from any toxic behavior and I see that i can't just walk away, I am in a bond and I can't just snap it right, but the key is here, because I learned that world is not going to change because you differ and you don't seek power, the only option left is to get rich and let money deal with the problems, but the chasing money is also like chasing power and then you will become what you hate the most. so, is it possible to distance ourself without leaving a person physically, and the only people you need to deal with are you family because outside anyway you can distance yourself even if you need to do the job with them if doesn't effect you much, but it takes so much to distance yourself from people, psychologically. And the only problem with attachment is that you want the person you are attach to become the best person you want to exist with, but they are not and you are attached and it makes you suffer. The solution lies in not expecting any change from any one if they make you day hell you are good, if they make you happy you are good. But if they are physically harming you, you need to leave. If they are choosing to attack you everyday, you need to leave. But, if the things are happening unconsciously and you are suffering, you can deal with that through removing the expectation of them ever getting changed. The are in conflict because of marrying the wrong person, they are not for each other and conflict happen and if you see that what ever is happening is the consequences of the action they did in the past like marrying without checking if they are compatible or not and then birthing you without checking if they are capable of raising a child, and now you are the consequence of their unawareness and in-compatibility and conflict bound to happen because its a consequence and you can not stop it. What you can stop is not repeating the same mistake. If your salary is less according to the life you want to live, don't marry. If you have anger issue and don't yet have any meaning in this life don't do kid, no matter what you have to do, the only way you can protect you child is to live with your reality and not produce them if you don't have the means or education to provide for the child. Other wise the same story will happen again. You can stop it. And right now the only action you can take is to cease all action and see what the fuck is going on. see all the consequences that are happening in you life, see where it begun see what you can do about it, and take action according to your threshold to endure the consequences. Like if you opt for smoking, don't fear cancer. If you opt for anything bear the cost in your mind.
