 I do not fear death. I have visited places that are feared by the average person, the kind of places that seasoned travelers break into a sweat at the mere thought of visiting.
I always travel with the friends that I made somewhere in the Himalayas. 

Once, I dreamed of a lake, where I went through the mountains of oak trees and waterfalls. It was at the height of eleven  thousand feet from the sea level. And the next day I saw the same lake on the internet. I took that as a sign from the universe. What kind of sign was it? I didn't knew, but my mother used to say things about these pilgrimage sites; we never decide to visit these places, only God chooses for us to visit them in mysterious ways.

“Mysterious ways,” I asked her.

Yes, God inspires us through our dreams or sends people towards us to inspire us to visit him”.

“Why does god want us to go to these far places, even though he is available everywhere”. I asked her patiently.

“This is how it used to happen, my mother told me that the places that are important for our religion are some kind of energy sources to help us dissolve our karma”. She told me politely.

I was confused and turned out to be a skeptic individual. I had a dream just like my mother had told me. God is calling me to visit him. I don't know what he wants from me but this is my chance to experience something my mother told me about. She told me to be faithful and keep myself in a sense of devotion on the journey.

The lake was magnificent, although few people on the way told me that it was abandoned for a while. They didn't tell me the reason and I did not ask anything. I had devotion in my heart. I was standing before a few majestic dried mountains, small rocks sliding down. And the damp green lake was below me. It was disgusting but still I dipped my toe into it and it was cold. I waited there for a while. I even shouted these exact words:

"I am here god. You inspired me through my dream, showing me your mystical cold lake. I am here. What do you want from me". I didn't get any answer. I remembered my mother, it has been so long that I haven't thought about her. When she passed away, my whole existence was lost and hope to live was not there, but as years had passed, everything turned out to be ok. My love for traveling began after her death and I lived a worthwhile life that I started to forget about her. Although I always loved traveling. But my mother never allowed me to go anywhere. She stopped me when my friends used to visit the corners of the country in the summer break. I gathered all my desires which bursted after her death and I never looked back until now, but for some days; she was alive in my mind.

 The sun was about to go down and I decided to camp here on the top.

I set up my tent and the night turned into this chilly winter. After eating some noodles i was in my sleeping bag when I felt uneasy, realizing that everything was so quite that i could hear my heartbeat, where did the chirping go, i knew it was there, i was listening to it. I snapped my fingers to confirm that I am not deaf. It had never happened to me. The background noise was always there. Why was this place so silent? I feared to step outside and inquire. I don't fear death but mysterious happenings are not just about death. My mother told me these weird mythological stories, claiming it to be true. She told me about a king who was stuck in the eternity. She told me about a man who looked in the god’s eyes and went blind. She told me about a forest where all the birds and animals go away at night because a certain god dances with his lover and you don’t wanna see that. You will be dead before seeing it.

Like that silent forest, this was a silent valley and maybe, the god was outside. Thank god my mother told me that this happened. I should go out with my eyes closed and talk to god.



I woke up at three thirty in the morning. I felt disgusted that how could i sleep in the process of making an important decision. The valley was still silent so God was still here. I got myself out from my sleeping bag and unzipped my tent and closed my eyes.

I stepped out. I was sensing a bright light through my closed eyes. Maybe my watch was broken. It didn't feel like three thirty in the morning. 

“God, I am here, you called me here through my dream. What do you want from me?”. I asked.

No one replied. "I am opening my eyes, please don't kill me. Even if I see you, don't kill me because you called me here. Ok. I won't open it, give me a sign, anything". I screamed but the sound did not feel like traveling far away, was it a sign to not open my eyes?



I opened my eyes anyway. My whole being was vibrating and sweating in this glacier wind. I was in a bright cloud. All I could see was a handful of distance. It was like a divine prison made out of bright clouds which was moving in the same place as if trying to hypnotize me. My heart was pounding so hard that I was hearing it in my head. It started to palpate. It started to skip for a few beats, I was losing consciousness and regaining it with my heart's will to beat or not. Then suddenly I was blank. No thoughts. My body was giving goosebumps. My heart was racing. The fear of death was not there. I was crying like a little kid. Nothing mattered in that moment. After ten minutes or something The bright clouds around me just turned purple and dark As if, the sun decided to go somewhere else.

My body was still stiff and confused from the experience, but I was back. I looked at my watch and five hours had passed. My mind didn't ask any questions about it and then  I thought of my mother. And I went back to my tent. Hoping I was in a dream and if I sleep here, I will wake up in the reality. And I thought to myself. What is reality?.
