I am ok with being famous, as long as its the by product of the work I'am doing or will be doing, but having said that, I do have a problem with being famous equally to a person who might get his biography written by someone, why we read biography is it because we are looking for a secret sauce for success or you admire the person and wants to be like him and are obsessed with him. People who need inspiration for the things they need to do are chasing some fucked up idea to get something else out of it. Like drinking beer to get tipsy. Creating a company to get rich. Getting married to get sex.
But if you were doing what you really love doing no matter if anyone is paying you or not, then its a different story no amount of motivation and no amount of inspiration is needed for that work because then you are fulfilled by the act itself. Thats the key to a fiction free life.
