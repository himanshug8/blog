title: "It was wounded"

I lay on my bed, felt the muscles stiff all over my body. My mind eased and the body stretched itself from tip to toe, and I relaxed even more.
I turned my head, looked at the wall clock. It's one in the afternoon. I looked away, lay blank. The fan was fluttering and the clock was ticking.
The sun was up and shining, gleaming before a large tree that was blocking the sun for me.
winter is coming and the owner had chopped parts of its thick branch for the sunbaths for himself. <!-- its has the s because it is used in terms of belonging not verb. -->
I looked at this freshly chopped thick wound It was still fresh and flies were onto it, hovering around, sucking the life off it's nerve endings. Adjacent to the fresh wound was another dry wound, healed . Means it has suffered this before. This tree is a survivor and will survive for the ages no-matter how much anyone hurt it, it will grow back and will reach for the sun as we all do.

In between the dense leaves, a patch of it was fluttering. I looked for the wind but it was not there. I scanned the branch and found a squirrel cleaning itself passionately using it's nose and cheek by constantly rubbing against it's tummy and to clean its back it would twist its upper body.
afterwards it began to eat its collected food. I couldn't see what it was but by the looks of it, it was enjoying it-self.
When it was done eating. It began its business. For some reason it started to squeak and went louder with every squeak as the intensity and pressure of its voice increased its tail wagged with it. The squeaking intensity increasing and decreasing making its furry tail looked like a harmonious piano piece.
After a while it moved and jumped to another branch and started to squeak. Seemed like alerting someone about something.

I wondered if they have language like we do. Its not possible, they do have signals for different things, but not the complex structure of languages like we do.

It leaped to another branch, squeaked for another few minutes. I found it painful that it is squealing for almost fifteen minutes and by the end I can sense pain in its voice.
She leaped again swiftly to lay flat onto a fat thick branch. For the first time it looked at me, and it was tired. I looked at it. It looked at me. It yawned. I yawned, before I can finally sleep it hit me, maybe someone close to it had died yesterday, when the owner chopped the branch off, the branch was thick and grown enough to support few squirrels and was equally dense enough to block the sunlight for a big room. Maybe it was looking for its mate who died with the chopped branch and it is also true that for the first time in my life I saw a squirrel alone on a big old tree.
I got up pulled out few hazelnuts from the package I had kept in the fridge and tossed it outside for it to pick.
I returned the package to its proper place when my eyes placed on a cat with patchy brown and white fur sleeping in the open alone. The sunlight shined on its fur and the tree with the fresh wound was casting the comforting shadows on its face. I went to my desk and got distracted.
